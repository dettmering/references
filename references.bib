	Abstract = {It has been suggested that fibrosis which develops after irradiation is caused by increases in vascular permeability. Plasma proteins leak into irradiated tissue where fibrinogen may be converted into fibrin which is gradually replaced by fibrous tissue. Vascular and fibrotic changes in mouse lung were investigated after X irradiation of the right hemithorax. Blood volume and accumulation of extravascular proteins were measured using indium (111In)-labeled red cells, iodinated (131I) albumin, and iodinated (125I) fibrinogen. Tracers were injected 1-47 weeks after irradiation and lungs were excised 24 or 96 hr later to determine radioactivity. The amount of collagen was estimated by measuring the hydroxyproline content. During the first few months after X rays, lung blood volume decreased to a plateau which depended on radiation dose (10-25 Gy). Small increases in extravascular albumin and fibrinogen occurred at 1-12 weeks after 10-25 Gy. Subsequently, protein returned to normal after 10 Gy, remained elevated after 15 Gy, and increased after 20 and 25 Gy. Hydroxyproline per gram of dry irradiated lung was increased at 18 weeks after 15-25 Gy. Subsequently it showed little change although both total hydroxyproline content and dry weight decreased after 20 and 25 Gy. Support for the hypothesis was that hydroxyproline per gram only increased after X-ray doses which caused marked extravasation of protein. There was no evidence, however, for deposition of 125I-fibrin or for a gradual increase in fibrosis corresponding to the prolonged excess of extravascular protein.},

	Abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis and architectural remodeling of tissues can severely disrupt lung function, often with fatal consequences. The etiology of pulmonary fibrotic diseases is varied, with an array of triggers including allergens, chemicals, radiation and environmental particles. However, the cause of one of the most common pulmonary fibrotic conditions, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is still unclear. This review examines common mechanisms of pulmonary wound-healing responses following lung injury, and highlights the pathogenesis of some of the most widespread pulmonary fibrotic diseases. A three phase model of wound repair is reviewed that includes; (1) injury; (2) inflammation; and (3) repair. In most pulmonary fibrotic conditions dysregulation at one or more of these phases has been reported. Chronic inflammation can lead to an imbalance in the production of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, and disrupt cellular recruitment. These changes coupled with excessive pro-fibrotic IL-13 and/or TGFbeta1 production can turn a well-controlled healing response into a pathogenic fibrotic response. Endogenous regulatory mechanisms are discussed including novel areas of therapeutic intervention. Restoring homeostasis to these dysregulated healing responses, or simply neutralizing the key pro-fibrotic mediators may prevent or slow the progression of pulmonary fibrosis.},

The result is a progressive loss of normal lung architecture and impairment in gas exchange. Pertinent features of the human disease include temporal heterogeneity of the fibrotic lesions, progressive nature of the disease, development of fibrotic foci, and in some patients, a rapid worsening of symptoms known as an acute exacerbation. No current animal model recapitulates all of these cardinal manifestations of the human disease. However, investigations using murine models have led to the identification of many pathological cells and mediators that are believed to be important in human disease as well.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate whether irradiating small lung volumes with a large dose or irradiating large lung volumes with a small dose, given the same mean lung dose (MLD), has a different effect on pulmonary function in laboratory animals.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: WAG/Rij/MCW male rats were exposed to single fractions of 300 kVp X-rays. Four treatments, in decreasing order of irradiated lung volume, were administered: (1) whole lung irradiation, (2) right lung irradiation, (3) left lung irradiation, and (4) irradiation of a small lung volume with four narrow beams. The irradiation times were chosen to accumulate the same MLD of 10, 12.5, or 15 Gy with each irradiated lung volume. The development of radiation-induced lung injury for < or =20 weeks was evaluated as increased breathing frequency, mortality, and histopathologic changes in the irradiated and control rats.
RESULTS: A significant elevation of respiratory rate, which correlated with the lung volume exposed to single small doses (> or =5 Gy), but not with the MLD, was observed. The survival of the rats in the whole-lung-irradiated group was MLD dependent, with all events occurring between 4.5 and 9 weeks after irradiation. No mortality was observed in the partial-volume irradiated rats.
CONCLUSIONS: The lung volume irradiated to small doses might be the dominant factor influencing the loss of pulmonary function in the rat model of radiation-induced lung injury. Caution should be used when new radiotherapy techniques that result in irradiation of large volumes of normal tissue are used for the treatment of lung cancer and other tumors in the thorax.},

@article{zaider1998,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: We address the question of whether or not, for the same average (or integral) dose, a smaller uniform dose to an entire normal tissue structure always results in a lower normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) than does a proportionally larger dose to a partial volume of the same structure.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A recent compilation of NTCP data and two theoretical formulations of the dependence of NTCP on dose and partial volume irradiated-the Lyman probit equation and the binomial model-are used to examine this question. Both models fit equally well available NTCP data.
RESULTS: Empirical data indicate that for lung, kidney, and possibly liver (but not for esophagus, brain, or heart), given a fixed tumor dose and fixed integral dose, NTCP can be minimized by irradiating a partial volume fraction rather than the entire normal organ. The binomial model supports this interpretation, whereas the probit model predicts that for all organs uniform irradiation of the whole organ always results in the lowest possible NTCP.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to what is commonly believed, this study suggests that for at least two normal tissues, namely lung and kidney, there may be situations where "a lot to a little" (i.e., fewer treatment ports) will result in higher tumor control probability and better treatment plan than "a little to a lot" (i.e., multifield treatment). This finding, which is independent of the binomial or probit models used here, depends only on the accuracy of the empirical NTCP data. It is also interesting to note that: a) lung and kidney are commonly classified as parallel tissues, while the others have more of a serial architecture; and b) the choice of the NTCP model can have a profound impact on treatment planning decisions.},

@article{willner2003,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether a little dose to a large normal lung volume or a high dose to a small lung volume is more critical for induction of clinical pneumonitis. The second question is if dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters are more reliable, if the lungs are analyzed as separate organs or as a whole organ.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and DVH data from 49 patients treated for a thoracic malignancy using 3-D conformal treatment plans. 18 patients had developed a clinical pneumonitis (CTC II or III). The majority of patients (n = 48) received radiochemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Patients were generally treated 5 fx/week, single dose 2 Gy, using a two-series approach (shrinking field) up to a total dose of 60-70 Gy. For every individual patient, the overall dose distribution was recalculated in the Helax-TMS by means of adding dose plans according to the total dose applied in each series. The lungs were defined both as separate organs and as a whole organ. Low-dose volume (< or = 10 Gy, Vlow), moderate-dose volume (> 10-40 Gy, Vmod) and high-dose volume (> 40 Gy, Vhigh), as well as V10-V40 and mean lung dose (MLD) were defined from the cumulative DVH. Dose-effect relationships were fitted with a logistic regression model.
RESULTS: Manifestation of clinical pneumonitis was within 3 months from termination of irradiation in all cases. For the ipsilateral lung, the incidence of pneumonitis was closely correlated to Vhigh. The pneumonitis rate increased from 13% up to 60%. By contrast, with increasing Vlow the pneumonitis rate dropped to < 10%. A similar but less pronounced effect was seen for the total lung. The lung volumes Vlow, Vmod and Vhigh of the ipsilateral, contralateral and whole lung were significantly correlated to the corresponding MLD. The incidence of pneumonitis increased with increasing MLD for the ipsilateral lung with a D50 of 32 Gy and a gamma 50 of 0.98. For the whole lung, the observed increase was less steep. MLD showed a close correlation to NTCP calculated by the Kutcher model. However, NTCP calculation overestimated the pneumonitis risk for the ipsilateral lung and underestimated the risk for the whole lung due to the steeper gradient. The logistic regression curve for the DVH parameters V10-V40 showed an increase of steepness toward higher doses. From the logistic regression curves, a DVH template indicating critical borders of V10-V40 was generated for the ipsilateral as well as for the total lung.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that it is reasonable to disperse the dose outside the target volume over large areas in order to reduce the volumes of lung receiving > 40 Gy. Reducing the high-dose volume reduces the pneumonitis rate more than a corresponding reduction in the low-dose regions of the DVH. Landmarks for DVH optimization as defined in this analysis may serve as a basis for DVH contrains in IMRT planning. Separate organ analysis produced more reliable results and should be preferred to whole-organ analysis, if techniques mainly involving one side of the lung are applied. Further validation of these constraints is necessary prior to general recommendation.},

	Abstract = {An important stage in tumorigenesis is the ability of a precancerous cell to escape natural anticancer signals imposed on it by neighboring cells and its microenvironment. We have previously characterized a system of intercellular induction of apoptosis whereby nontransformed cells selectively remove transformed cells from coculture via cytokine and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) signaling. We report that irradiation of nontransformed cells with low doses of either high linear energy transfer (LET) alpha-particles or low-LET gamma-rays leads to stimulation of intercellular induction of apoptosis. The use of scavengers and inhibitors confirms the involvement of ROS/RNS signaling and of the importance of transformed cell NADPH oxidase in the selectivity of the system. Doses as low as 2-mGy gamma-rays and 0.29-mGy alpha-particles were sufficient to produce an observable increase in transformed cell apoptosis. This radiation-stimulated effect saturates at very low doses (50 mGy for gamma-rays and 25 mGy for alpha-particles). The use of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) neutralizing antibody confirms a role for the cytokine in the radiation-induced signaling. The system may represent a natural anticancer mechanism stimulated by extremely low doses of ionizing radiation.},

@article{tenhumberg2007,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate further the relationship between high linear energy transfer (LET) induced cell cycle arrests and the yield of chromosome aberrations observable in normal human fibroblasts at the first post-irradiation mitosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Normal human fibroblasts (AG01,522C) were exposed in G0/G1 to either 11 MeV u(-1) C ions (LET = 153.5 keV microm(-1)) or 9.9 MeV u(-1) Ni ions (LET = 2,455 keV microm(-1)), subcultured in medium containing 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and at multiple time-points post-irradiation the yield of chromosomal damage, the mitotic index and the cumulative BrdU-labelling index were determined. Furthermore, a mathematical approach was used to analyse the entire cell population.
RESULTS: Following high LET exposure normal fibroblasts suffer a transient delay into S-phase and into mitosis as well as a prolonged, probably permanent cell cycle arrest in the initial G0/G1-phase. Cells that reach the first mitosis at early times carried less aberrations than those collected at later times indicating a relationship between cell cycle delay and the number of aberrations. However, with respect to the whole cell population, only a few aberrant fibroblasts are able to progress to the first mitosis. For all endpoints studied the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of C ions is in the range of 2 - 4, while for Ni ions RBE < 1 is estimated. In contrast, when compared on a per particle basis Ni ions with the higher ionization density were found to be more effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Detailed analysis of the data demonstrates that the number of fibroblasts at risk for neoplastic transformation is significantly reduced by a chronic cell cycle arrest in the initial G0/G1-phase and, for the first time, the LET-dependence of this effect has been shown.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the number of initial chromatid breaks induced by low- or high-LET irradiations, and to compare the kinetics of chromatid break rejoining for radiations of different quality.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exponentially growing human fibroblast cells AG1522 were irradiated with gamma-rays, energetic carbon (290MeV/u), silicon (490MeV/u) and iron (200 and 600 MeV/u). Chromosomes were prematurely condensed using calyculin A. Chromatid breaks and exchanges in G2 cells were scored. PCC were collected after several post-irradiation incubation times, ranging from 5 to 600 min.
RESULTS: The kinetics of chromatid break rejoining following low- or high-LET irradiation consisted of two exponential components representing a rapid and a slow time constant. Chromatid breaks decreased rapidly during the first 10min after exposure, then continued to decrease at a slower rate. The rejoining kinetics were similar for exposure to each type of radiation. Chromatid exchanges were also formed quickly. Compared to low-LET radiation, isochromatid breaks were produced more frequently and the proportion of unrejoined breaks was higher for high-LET radiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with gamma-rays, isochromatid breaks were observed more frequently in high-LET irradiated samples, suggesting that an increase in isochromatid breaks is a signature of high-LET radiation exposure.},

This observation is supported by the argument that high-LET radiation induced DNA breaks that are more complex in nature and, thus, less likely to be repaired. In most cases the doses used in these studies were very high. We have studied unrejoined chromosome breaks by analyzing chromosome aberrations using a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique with a combination of whole chromosome specific probes and probes specific for the telomere region of the chromosomes. Confluent human fibroblast cells (AG1522) were irradiated with gamma rays, 490 MeV/nucleon Si, or with Fe ions at either 200 and 500 MeV/nucleon, and were allowed to repair at 37 degrees C for 24 hours after exposure. A chemically induced premature chromosome condensation (PCC) technique was used to condense chromosomes in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Results showed that the frequency of unrejoined chromosome breaks was higher after high-LET radiation, and the ratio of unrejoined to misrejoined chromosome breaks increased steadily with LET up a peak value at 440 keV/microm.},

	Abstract = {Although the p16(INK4a) and p21Waf1/Cip1 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors are known to play key roles in cellular senescence in vitro, their roles in senescence remain rather poorly understood in vivo. This situation is partly due to the possibility of compensatory effect(s) between p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 or to the upregulation of functionally related CDK inhibitors. To directly address the cooperative roles of p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in senescence in vivo, we generated a mouse line simply lacking both p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 genes [double-knockout (DKO)]. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from DKO mice displayed no evidence of cellular senescence when cultured serially in vitro. Moreover, DKO MEFs readily escaped Ras-induced senescence and overrode contact inhibition in culture. This was not the case in MEFs lacking either p16INK4a or p21Waf1/Cip1, indicating that p16(INK4a) and p21Waf1/Cip1 play cooperative roles in cellular senescence and contact inhibition in vitro. Notably, we found the DKO mice to be extremely susceptible to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced skin carcinogenesis that involves oncogenic mutation of the H-ras gene. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the high incidence of cancer in DKO mice likely reflected a cooperative effect of increased benign skin tumor formation caused by p21Waf1/Cip1 loss, with increased malignant conversion of benign skin tumors caused by p16(INK4a) loss. Our findings establish an intrinsic cooperation between p16INK4a and p21Waf1/Cip1 in the onset of cellular senescence and tumor suppression in vivo.},

Here we provide evidence showing that high p21 protein levels are necessary to enter and maintain the quiescence state following contact inhibition and growth factor withdrawal. In fact, entry into quiescence was impaired, both in human fibroblasts in which p21 gene has been deleted, or protein expression knocked-down by RNA interference. Importantly, in the absence of p21, human fibroblasts activate a DNA damage-like signalling pathway, as shown by phosphorylation of histone H2AX and Chk1 proteins. In addition, we show that in the absence of p21, checkpoint is activated by an unscheduled entry into S phase, with a reduced efficiency in DNA maturation, in the presence of high c-myc protein levels. These results highlight the role of p21 in counteracting inappropriate proliferation stimuli for genome stability maintenance.},

	Abstract = {Skin complications were recently reported after carbon-ion (C-ion) radiation therapy. Oxidative stress is considered an important pathway in the appearance of late skin reactions. We evaluated oxidative stress in normal human skin fibroblasts after carbon-ion vs. X-ray irradiation. Survival curves and radiobiological parameters were calculated. DNA damage was quantified, as were lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonylation and antioxidant enzyme activities. Reduced and oxidized glutathione ratios (GSH/GSSG) were determined. Proinflammatory cytokine secretion in culture supernatants was evaluated. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of C-ions vs. X-rays was 4.8 at D₀ (irradiation dose corresponding to a surviving fraction of 37%). Surviving fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) was 71.8% and 7.6% for X-rays and C-ions, respectively. Compared with X-rays, immediate DNA damage was increased less after C-ions, but a late increase was observed at D(10%) (irradiation dose corresponding to a surviving fraction of 10%). LPO products and protein carbonyls were only increased 24 hours after C-ions. After X-rays, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was strongly increased immediately and on day 14 at D(0%) (irradiation dose corresponding to a surviving fraction of around 0%), catalase activity was unchanged and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was increased only on day 14. These activities were decreased after C-ions compared with X-rays. GSH/GSSG was unchanged after X-rays but was decreased immediately after C-ion irradiation before an increase from day 7. Secretion of IL-6 was increased at late times after X-ray irradiation. After C-ion irradiation, IL-6 concentration was increased on day 7 but was lower compared with X-rays at later times. C-ion effects on normal human skin fibroblasts seemed to be harmful in comparison with X-rays as they produce late DNA damage, LPO products and protein carbonyls, and as they decrease antioxidant defences. Mechanisms leading to this discrepancy between the two types of radiation should be investigated.},

	Abstract = {To assess why during in vitro aging of fibroblasts the maintenance of chromosomal stability is effective or occasionally fails, a detailed cytogenetic analysis was performed in normal human IMR-90 fetal lung fibroblasts. The onset of senescence was inferred from proliferation activity, expression pattern of cell cycle regulating proteins, activity of β-galactosidase, and morphological features. Over the period of proliferation, a moderate increase of non-transmissible structural chromosomal aberrations was observed. In addition, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH and mBAND) techniques, we detected clonally expanding translocations in up to 70% of the analyzed metaphases, all involving one homolog of chromosome 9 as an acceptor. Notably, chromosomes are randomly involved as donor-chromosomes of the translocated terminal acentric fragments. These fragments result from duplication because the donor chromosomes are apparently unchanged. Interstitial telomeric signals were detectable at fusion sites, most likely belonging to chromosome 9. Quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (QFISH) detecting telomere sequences, followed by mFISH technique revealed that already in young cells the respective telomeres of one chromosome 9 were particularly short. For the first time, we have observed dysfunctional telomeres of one specific chromosome in normal human cells that have been stabilized by duplicated terminal sequences.},

	Abstract = {The occurrence of bystander effects has challenged the evaluation of risk for heavy ions, mainly in the context of space exploration and the increasing application of carbon ions in radiotherapy. In the present study, we addressed whether heavy-ion-induced DNA and cytogenetic damage is detectable in bystander cells. The formation of gamma-H2AX foci, sister chromatid exchanges and micronuclei were used as markers of damage to DNA. Normal human fibroblasts were exposed to low fluences of carbon and uranium ions, and alternatively single cells were targeted with heavy ions using the GSI microbeam. We did not observe a significant increase in the bystander formation of gamma-H2AX foci, sister chromatid exchanges or micronuclei. In addition, we performed for the first time parallel experiments at two microbeam facilities (GSI, JAEA) using the same cell line, culture conditions and irradiation protocols. No significant enhancement of the micronucleus frequencies in bystander cells was detected after targeted carbon-ion irradiation, confirming the results. Details regarding the history, culture conditions or support of the cells might be affecting the detection of bystander effects. On the other hand, the potential X-ray- and heavy-ion-induced bystander effects investigated herein clearly do not exceed the experimental error and thus are either lacking or are less pronounced than the effects reported in the literature for similar end points after alpha-particle and X-ray exposure.},

@article{droge2002,
	Abstract = {At high concentrations, free radicals and radical-derived, nonradical reactive species are hazardous for living organisms and damage all major cellular constituents. At moderate concentrations, however, nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anion, and related reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role as regulatory mediators in signaling processes. Many of the ROS-mediated responses actually protect the cells against oxidative stress and reestablish "redox homeostasis." Higher organisms, however, have evolved the use of NO and ROS also as signaling molecules for other physiological functions. These include regulation of vascular tone, monitoring of oxygen tension in the control of ventilation and erythropoietin production, and signal transduction from membrane receptors in various physiological processes. NO and ROS are typically generated in these cases by tightly regulated enzymes such as NO synthase (NOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms, respectively. In a given signaling protein, oxidative attack induces either a loss of function, a gain of function, or a switch to a different function. Excessive amounts of ROS may arise either from excessive stimulation of NAD(P)H oxidases or from less well-regulated sources such as the mitochondrial electron-transport chain. In mitochondria, ROS are generated as undesirable side products of the oxidative energy metabolism. An excessive and/or sustained increase in ROS production has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, obstructive sleep apnea, and other diseases. In addition, free radicals have been implicated in the mechanism of senescence. That the process of aging may result, at least in part, from radical-mediated oxidative damage was proposed more than 40 years ago by Harman (J Gerontol 11: 298-300, 1956). There is growing evidence that aging involves, in addition, progressive changes in free radical-mediated regulatory processes that result in altered gene expression.},

	Abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS), chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen, can form as a natural byproduct of the normal metabolism of oxygen and also have their crucial roles in cell homeostasis. Of note, the major intracellular sources including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), peroxisomes and the NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex have been identified in cell membranes to produce ROS. Interestingly, autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation process in which a cell degrades long-lived proteins and damaged organelles, has recently been well-characterized to be regulated by different types of ROS. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that ROS-modulated autophagy has numerous links to a number of pathological processes, including cancer, ageing, neurodegenerative diseases, type-II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, muscular disorders, hepatic encephalopathy and immunity diseases. In this review, we focus on summarizing the molecular mechanisms of ROS-regulated autophagy and their relevance to diverse diseases, which would shed new light on more ROS modulators as potential therapeutic drugs for fighting human diseases.},

	Abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},
